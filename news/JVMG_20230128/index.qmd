On 27-28 January, I'll be presenting the GOLEM project at a workshop organized by the [Japanese Visual Media Graph project](https://jvmg.iuk.hdm-stuttgart.de) at at Stuttgart Media University. Thanks to Magnus Pfeffer, Martin Roth, and Zoltan Kacsuk for the invitation.

This is a very meaningful occasion because I started following the JVMG project in 2020 and I'm happy to see that the project will have e second phase in whch there will be a collaboration with GOLEM. More details about this will follow in due time.
