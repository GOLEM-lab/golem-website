We'll a poster at the [Computational Humanities Research conference](https://2023.computational-humanities-research.org/programme/) in Paris. Year after year, this is becoming the most important and widely attended conference for computational approaches to the humanities.

We'll also present a short paper looking at how problematic the modellization and oprationalization of narrative events' detection is: "[Evaluation and Alignment of Movie Events Extracted via Machine Learning from a Narratological Perspective](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3558/paper441.pdf)" by Feng Zhou and Federico Pianzola.
