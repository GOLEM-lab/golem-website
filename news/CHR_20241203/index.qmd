We'll have three posters at the [Computational Humanities Research conference](https://2024.computational-humanities-research.org/programme/) in Aarhus. This is now established as the most important and widely attended conference for computational approaches to the humanities.

Full papers of the posters are available on the [Publications](https://golemlab.eu/publications/) page.
