The GOLEM project will officially start in January 2023 and we're looking for 4 people to join the team:

- 1 Postdoc
- 1 Database Technician **// Update: application closed, selection ongoing**
- 2 PhDs **// Update: application closed, selection ongoing**

## Postdoc

**// Update: application closed**

Applications are invited for a 1.5 year position as postdoctoral researcher with expertise in graph databases, ontology creation, and graph reasoning.

In collaboration with the PI and a technician, you will work on the definition of an ontology and creation of a graph database compatible with Wikidata and other projects about the digitization of literary texts.

You will contribute to:

- define the ontology to be used throughout the project
- enrich a triple store (knowledge graph database) with information obtained via rule-
based and graph reasoning techniques
- use graph-based representations for ontology learning
- use graph-based strategies for semantic relation identification
- use graph-based methods to populate ontologies using textual data.

See the [official announcment](https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/work-with-us/job-opportunities/?details=00347-02S0009QSP) for more information and to apply.

## Database Technician

You will contribute to:

- collect data via APIs and web scraping
- organize data in a local database
- set up and maintain a triple store with extracted metadata
- ensure communication between the local database and the triple store with a public SPARQL endpoint.

## PhD students

**// Update: application closed**

### 2 PhD positions in Digital Humanities and Natural Language Processing

In collaboration with the other team members, you will work on your own multilingual and cross-cultural research project. The project is very interdisciplinary, combining computational methods for the analysis of language and culture and psychometric experiments with readers. The focus will be on changes over a time span of 20 years in how people write (fanfiction) stories, in terms of themes, tropes, and style. In parallel, you will also look at how these changes influence the reception of stories. You will learn skills related to database management, linked data, data science, machine learning, and experimental design for reading research.

The universtiy of Groningen has very strong researchers working in Digital Humanities, Computational Linguistics, and Media Studies from which you can learn a lot. 

See the [official announcement](https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/work-with-us/job-opportunities/?details=00347-02S0009QIP&cat=wp) for more information and to apply.

We also accept applications for externally funded PhD students and for internships. For example:

- for Australians, the [John Monash Scholarship](https://www.johnmonash.com/scholarships/benefits)
- for Chinese, the China Scholarship Council (CSC) + top-up from the University of Groningen
- for Indonesians, [LPDP/DIKTI overseas scholarship](https://www.rug.nl/education/scholarships/lpdp-dikti-overseas-scholarship)
- if you received your Master degree in the Netherlands, [NWO PhD in the Humanities](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/phds-humanities)
- you can also check the [grant finder](https://www.rug.nl/education/scholarships/findscholarships) for PhD in the Netherlands
