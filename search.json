The GOLEM project will analyze stories and their responses gathered from sites in five different languages – English, Spanish, Italian, Korean and Indonesian. This analysis can provide a wealth of information about the characters in a story, the genre, what a story is about, how a story is constructed, what themes are covered, as well as what readers from different countries and cultures find important in a story.\n\nWhat (linguistic, stylistic, thematic) elements in a story become popular in different languages?\nWhat makes a story get read, and what do readers value in a story?\n\nThe information we collect with this research makes it possible, with the help of computer models, to find answers to these kinds of questions. The goal is to test hypotheses about cultural evolution and develop a methodology that can also be applied to books from other periods in history. In this way, we can study the evolution of fiction over the centuries, and gain unprecedented insight into something as old as humanity itself: storytelling"

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nThe goal of GOLEM is to model the evolution of fiction in the context of digitalized and datafied culture, the so-called “digital literary sphere”. We will pursue this goal combining tools from computational literary studies and cultural evolution research. The outcomes of the project will be:\n\na knowledge graph database with interlinked metadata about millions of stories (shared online between 2000 and 2021) and readers’ response to them;\nnew formal models (theoretical and computational) to study fiction and reader response;\nan evolutionary account of how fiction evolves in terms of formal features and its effect on readers.\n\nThe GOLEM workflow will consist of four work packages:\n\nWP1. Knowledge graph database: the organization, interlinking, and storage of metadata about stories (stylistic elements, themes, etc.) and reader response (emotions felt, etc.) into a knowledge graph.\nWP2. Metadata generation: the generation of new metadata about textual features and reader response through modelling and machine learning. These metadata will then enrich the graph database.\nWP3. Hypotheses testing: the testing of evolutionary hypotheses using the knowledge graph database to select predictors and target variables of statistical models, and to create evolutionary models.\nWP4. Cross-validation with readers: the empirical qualitative and quantitative cross-validation with readers of the results from previous WPs, also in controlled experiments.\n\n“Metadata” (or “derivative data”) are all the descriptive or evaluative attributes assigned to a story, by lay readers, experts, or machines. Hence, metadata encode information related to cultural traits as various as genre, style, sentiment, themes, ratings, readers’ emotional response, etc., which will be stored in a graph database (WP1) in the form of statements (triples) of the kind: story1, is_instance_of, genre_romance, comment9, is_response_to, story1, and empathy, is_expressed_in, comment9. Metadata are an essential part of the GOLEM methodology, since they will be used as parameters when modelling the effects of fiction and its evolution (WP3). Therefore, besides the metadata collected from various datasets, additional metadata will be generated (WP2), in manual or automated ways, from stories and comments/reviews. These additional metadata will belong to classes defined in an ontology (developed in WP1), and they will mainly concern five aspects: genre, story elements, topics, stylistic elements, engagement. Eventually, they will be included in the graph database and linked to the appropriate stories, enriching their schematic representation and offering more parameters to create statistical models and test evolutionary hypotheses (WP3).\nMetadata will be generated (WP2) for both textual features and reader response features, and used (WP1) for two purposes: (i) to identify new cultural traits that could be added as classes of the GOLEM ontology and better describe stories; (ii) to expand the GOLEM knowledge graph by linking the stories in the datasets to the classes of the ontology. Then the knowledge stored in the graph database will be used to test evolutionary hypotheses (WP3), verifying the quality of methodology and results thanks to regular assessments and experiments in controlled conditions (WP4).\n\n\n\nFigure1\n\n\nDiagram of the project overall workflow. I highlighted in orange the process of assessment of metadata quality, which is part of the risk management strategy. Blue arrows indicate the process through which the graph database is continuously enlarged and enriched.\nThe representation of a story in a graph database is different from its representation as a digital edition with textual encoding (e.g. using TEI-XML). In a digital edition, the text-as-an-object is the starting point and the TEI version is a machine-readable description of it. In a knowledge graph, there is no centre, it is a network of interlinked data. Or, if we consider the text of a story as “data”, then the knowledge graph is a network of metadata describing various aspects of the text. A graph is a model of the text, generated according to some predefined rules that record the textual information and transform it into statements (triples). As such, a graph is a model based on some interpretative rules, which are declared openly (and recorded in the database) and thus allow for a transparent reconstruction of the process that led to a certain interpretation. But GOLEM also adopts a broader perspective – following the tradition of reception theory – and considers a story not as an isolated system but rather as part of a system of which the reader is also part. The GOLEM knowledge graph will be an innovative way of modelling stories as part of a social system, in which readers are represented as interacting with stories and between them, talking about stories.\n\nSimilar projects:\n\nDraCor\nMiMoText\nDigital Observatory of World Literature\nJapanese Visual Media Graph (JVMG)\nThe Under-Represented Writers Project\nTheme Ontology"

Disciplines and paradigms have their own specificities, which implicitly shape how we approach narrative phenomena. To make explicit such processes of selection and contextualization is an act of intellectual honesty and I suggest how to do it in three simple steps: (i) adopting a systemic perspective, (ii) distinguishing between logical levels, (iii) employing the Proteus Principle in the formation of theories. Narrative is seen and used in many different ways that can be conceived as systems, i.e. considering that the properties of narrative cannot be studied in isolation but are interconnected in a network of relations where all the components are influencing each other.\nPianzola, F.

In particular, we focus on cumulative cultural evolution, that is, the idea that cultural systems improve with time, drawing on previous innovations. In this study we examine two features of cumulative culture: accumulation and improvement. First, we show that stories in Harry Potter’s fan fiction accumulate cultural traits—unique tags, in our analysis—through time, both globally and at the level of single stories. Second, more recent stories are also liked more by readers than earlier stories. Our research illustrates the potential of the combination of cultural evolution theory and digital literary studies, and it paves the way for the study of the effects of online digital media on cultural cumulation.\nIn CHR 2020: Workshop on Computational Humanities Research, November 18–20, 2020, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"

    "text": "Abstract\nPresence, flow, narrative absorption, immersion, transportation, and similar subjective phenomena are studied in many different disciplines, mostly in relation to mediated experiences (books, film, VR, games). Moreover, since real, virtual, or fictional agents are often involved, concepts like identification and state empathy are often linked to engaging media use. Based on a scoping review that identified similarities in the wording of various questionnaire items conceived to measure different phenomena, we categorize items into the most relevant psychological aspects and use this categorization to propose an interdisciplinary systematization. Then, based on a framework of embodied predictive processing, we present a new cognitive model of presence-related phenomena for mediated and non-mediated experiences, integrating spatial and temporal aspects and also considering the role of fiction and media design. Key processes described within the model are: selective attention, enactment of intentions, and interoception. We claim that presence is the state of perceived successful agency of an embodied mind able to correctly enact its predictions. The difference between real-life and simulated experiences (“book problem,” “paradox of fiction”) lays in the different precision weighting of exteroceptive and interoceptive signals.\nPianzola, F., Riva, G., Kukkonen, K., & Mantovani, F.

During this time, the field has changed according to the general changes in evolutionary thinking. I will review the characteristics of what I call the three waves of Evolutionary Aesthetics in relation to their historical contexts as well as each other.\n10:35–11:05 Mikko Ijäs: “The cognitive research approach of prehistoric art”\nThe Finnish researcher Mikko Ijäs will give a presentation on cognitive research of prehistoric rock-art. The cognitive changes the hunters have described, such as transformation experiences into a hunted prey animal, could be attributed to some of the earliest imagery humans have ever made.\n11:05–11:35 Federico Pianzola: “Testing evolutionary hypotheses for fiction”\nMy hypothesis is that fiction is a cultural cognitive tool evolving towards forms that elicit stronger presence and narrative absorption. In other words, the fictional forms that survive are those able to elicit more intense embodied simulations. I will present how this hypothesis can be tested combining computational text analysis and empirical research with readers.\n11:35–12:05 Mariagrazia Portera: “(Non-human) animal aesthetics? Promises and challenges of a comparative research program in aesthetics”\nWithin the field of evolutionary aesthetics, there has been traditionally (apart from anecdotal reports) only limited research on comparative approaches to aesthetics, i.e. on the idea that non-human animals possess an aesthetic capacity more or less in the same way that human beings do. This was, however, Charles Darwin’s main assumption in his evolutionary theory. In this paper, I shall use the concept of “mosaic evolution” to describe human aesthetic capacity as a multifactorial trait whose simplest expressions might have preceded Homo sapiens; each of the factors involved in human aesthetic capacity might have evolved at different times in different species, due to different mechanisms (exaptation, adaptation, non-adaptive structural side effect) and according to different comparative relationships (structural, phylogenetic, genetic homology, convergence)."

    "title": "What is a Golem?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I could probably write an essay about what a golem is and what role the myth of the golem has in literary history, but I won’t. I’ve actually talked about it in a book, in Italian, about different golems: the Hebrew myth, robots, and a short story by Primo Levi.\n\nPrimo Levi, The Servant (1968-70)\n\n\nBuilding a Golem is not in itself a difficult undertaking, and many have tried it. In fact, a Golem is only a little more than nothing; it’s a portion of matter, or rather of chaos, closed up in a human or animal likeness. In short, it’s a simulacrum and, as such, good for nothing.\n\n\nThe difference among Golems lies in the precision and thoroughness of the instructions that guide their construction. […] Now, Aryeh was not a blasphemer, and he wasn’t proposing to create a second Adam. He intended to construct not a man, but, rather, a po’el—let’s call him a worker—a servant, faithful and strong, if not too discerning: in other words, what’s called in his Bohemian language a robot.\n\n\nIn order to achieve this, instructions were required of a more complex nature than those needed to make an idol that sits inactive and sneering in its niche, but not so complex as those needed for creating a second Adam—-“a being made in the image of God.” You needn’t search for these instructions in the whirlwind of a starry sky, or in a crystal ball, or in the gibberish of the Python Spirit; they are already written, hidden in the books of the Law, all you have to do is read and choose—-that is, select, elect. Not one letter, not one mark on the scrolls of the Law is there by chance; to one who knows how to read them, all appears clear, any undertaking, past, present, and future; the formula and the destiny of humanity and of every man, your own, and those of all flesh, down to the blind worm that makes its way in the mud. Aryeh made his calculations and produced the formula he desired for a Golem, one that would not surpass human abilities. Its composition filled thirty-nine pages, the exact number of his children, and the coincidence pleased him.\n\n\nHe was a giant with a human figure from the belt upward. Even this has an explanation: the belt is a frontier, only above the belt is man made in God’s image, while below he is a beast. For this reason, a wise man does not forget to wear it. Below the belt the Golem was truly a Golem-—that is, a fragment of chaos. Behind his chain mail, which hung to the ground like an apron, all that could be glimpsed was a solid jumble of clay, metal, and glass.\n\nAs Levi said years later, this is “an ironic reworking of the Golem legend, it is imagined that Rabbi Löw of Prague knew the secrets of genetics and computer science, and that therefore the Golem himself, his creature, was nothing but a robot” (Itinerary of a Jewish Writer, 1982).\nPrimo Levi’s golem is also a good metaphor of this project. Our GOLEM has a clearly defiend body shape only above the belt: these are the structured metadata and the textual features extracted from stories. Below that there is a mass without clear shape when looked from a distance, the unstructured data formed by the text of the stories, which are made of language and human creativity, and express much more than what the metadata can grasp.\nThe history of the golem is also a interesting because it underwent several transformations over the centuries. This is what our GOLEM wants to track, the changes that fictional forms undergo when they cross languages, cultures, and time.\nBefore the figure of the golem entered the collective Western imagination through 19th-century Jewish folklore and the early literary and theatrical adaptations of the time, the contexts in which such a mythologem was developed were those of Jewish theology, mysticism, and magic. In the Torah the term golem appears only once, in Psalm 139, while in the Talmud and Midrashim the word is used both in reference to Adam and in reporting some episodes of the creation of one man by another. Moreover, from the 12th century onward the theme is also attested in Kabbalistic writings (Moshe Idel, The Golem).\nMoshe Idel observed that among all the medieval texts he has collated, only in a couple of cases can golem reasonably be interpreted as “amorphous,” and he therefore wonders why this meaning has been transposed into the modern tradition, spreading so widely. The suggested answer is the same as that advanced by Gershom Scholem, namely, that medieval Hebrew philosophy uses it as a Hebrew term for matter, the formless hyle.\nIn the 13th century, a new element appears in the golem’s story: in the context of Ashkenazi Chassidism emerges what Idel considers an original contribution to the myth, namely the use of the alphabet as an essential component of the procedures for animating the creature (Idel, The Golem, p. 78; cf. Eleazar of Worms, Commentary on Sefer Yezirah, fol. 15D).\n\n\n\nRabbi Loew and Golem by Mikoláš Aleš, 1899\n\n\nIt is from the 19th century onward that the Golem myth begins to become more articulated, and the themes that emerge in the narratives of that period gradually emancipate themselves from the importance given to the moment of the anthropoid’s creation. Largely due to the wide dissemination of the legend of Rabbi Loew, the golem becomes a creature capable of various achievements and its psychology becomes the subject of imaginative hypotheses (Idel, The Golem, pp. 268-69). In Rabbi Loew’s story, the creation of the Golem is no longer merely a magical or mystical act concerning some wise person: while not leaving out the procedure necessary to shape and animate the artificial creature, the emphasis is more on the social function of the enterprise, which is initiated to give the Jews of the Prague ghetto a defender to protect them from anti-Semitic attacks and pogroms. The 19th century is also the century in which mythologem crossed the threshold of Jewish communities to enter the shared imagination of much of Europe thanks to Mary Shelley’s short story Frankenstein (1818).\n\n\n\nCover of the first edition of R.U.R. by Karel Čapek.\n\n\nSince the early 20th century, there have been numerous contributions to the dissemination of the legend in non-Jewish circles: literary, theatrical, and cinematic works have elaborated and transformed the golem mythologem in various ways (Gustav Meyrink 1915, Der Golem; Paul Wegener 1920, The Golem: How He Came into the World; Karel Čapek 1921, R.U.R. Rossum’s Universal Robots). Čapek is the first to transform the myth by placing it in a radically different context, i.e., in a world in which the transition from artisanal forms of production to the capitalist industrial system was established. In the era of technical reproducibility, the creation of the golem becomes a process of serial production in the factory. This socio-economic upheaval is so drastic that it has strong repercussions on the way the golem is conceived: designed as a robot, its function is no longer that of a heroic defender of the ghetto from the enemies of the Jews: in the novel, the golems are workers, a link that can be inserted into the assembly lines of many industries. From R.U.R. onward, myth and reality began to converge more and more - Levi himself called his own computer “golem” (The Scribe, 1984) - and science fiction has come to create myths so incisive and popular that one often no longer feels the need to compare the multitude of stories of cyborgs, robots, and artificial intelligences of various kinds with the Jewish myth of the golem.\nOur GOLEM is a golem containing the knowledge of many other golems. And we want to make sure that its construction can be replicated by knowing the genetic code and computer language used to create it in the first place. However, we are aware that creativity and reading are practices with an exceptional component that cannot be completely reduced to any schema. Indeed, it is madness and ardor that trigger Rabbi Loew’ creative process and also its golem’s self-determination."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe end of deep reading is a commonplace in public debates, whenever societies talk about youth, books, and the digital age. In contrast to this, we show for the first time and in detail, how intensively young readers write and comment literary texts at an unprecedented scale. We present several analyses of how fiction is transmitted through the social reading platform Wattpad, one of the largest platforms for user-generated stories, including novels, fanfiction, humour, classics, and poetry. By mixed quantitative and qualitative methods and scalable reading we scrutinise texts and comments on Wattpad, what themes are preferred in 13 languages, what role does genre play for readers behaviour, and what kind of emotional engagement is prevalent when young readers share stories. Our results point out the rise of a global reading culture in youth reading besides national preferences for certain topics and genres, patterns of reading engagement, aesthetic values and social interaction. When reading Teen Fiction social-bonding (affective interaction) is prevalent, when reading Classics social-cognitive interaction (collective intelligence) is prevalent. An educational outcome suggests that readers who engage in Teen Fiction learn to read Classics and to judge books not only indirect emotional response toc haracter’s behaviour, but focusing more on contextualised interpretation of the text.\nPianzola, F., Rebora, S., & Lauer, G.
