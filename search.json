The project is very interdisciplinary, combining computational methods for the analysis of language and culture and psychometric experiments with readers. The focus will be on changes over a time span of 20 years in how people write (fanfiction) stories, in terms of themes, tropes, and style. In parallel, you will also look at how these changes influence the reception of stories. You will learn skills related to database management, linked data, data science, machine learning, and experimental design for reading research.\nThe universtiy of Groningen has very strong researchers working in Digital Humanities, Computational Linguistics, and Media Studies from which you can learn a lot.\nSee the official announcement for more information and to apply."

    "text": "The project\n\nThe “Graphs and Ontologies for Literary Evolution Models” is a 5-year (2023-2027) research project funded by the European Commission (ERC StG).\nThe goal of the project is to create accurate models of how the (formal and content-related) cultural traits of fiction spread and combine. The data used are fanfiction stories in 5 different languages (English, Spanish, Italian, Korean, and Indonesian) gathered from various online platforms.\nThe methodology combines mainly computational literary studies and cultural evolution theory, with influences from fan studies and information science.\nThe project is hosted by the Center for Langugage and Cognition and the Center for Digital Humanities of the University of Groningen (Netherlands).\n\nMillions of stories are shared on online platforms such as Wattpad, AO3, and Fanfiction.net, combined with readers’ reactions and comments on these stories. The GOLEM project will analyze stories and their responses gathered from sites in five different languages – English, Spanish, Italian, Korean and Indonesian. This analysis can provide a wealth of information about the characters in a story, the genre, what a story is about, how a story is constructed, what themes are covered, as well as what readers from different countries and cultures find important in a story.\n\nWhat (linguistic, stylistic, thematic) elements in a story become popular in different languages?\nWhat makes a story get read, and what do readers value in a story?\n\nThe information we collect with this research makes it possible, with the help of computer models, to find answers to these kinds of questions. The goal is to test hypotheses about cultural evolution and develop a methodology that can also be applied to books from other periods in history. In this way, we can study the evolution of fiction over the centuries, and gain unprecedented insight into something as old as humanity itself: storytelling"

    "text": "Abstract\nThe end of deep reading is a commonplace in public debates, whenever societies talk about youth, books, and the digital age. In contrast to this, we show for the first time and in detail, how intensively young readers write and comment literary texts at an unprecedented scale. We present several analyses of how fiction is transmitted through the social reading platform Wattpad, one of the largest platforms for user-generated stories, including novels, fanfiction, humour, classics, and poetry. By mixed quantitative and qualitative methods and scalable reading we scrutinise texts and comments on Wattpad, what themes are preferred in 13 languages, what role does genre play for readers behaviour, and what kind of emotional engagement is prevalent when young readers share stories. Our results point out the rise of a global reading culture in youth reading besides national preferences for certain topics and genres, patterns of reading engagement, aesthetic values and social interaction. When reading Teen Fiction social-bonding (affective interaction) is prevalent, when reading Classics social-cognitive interaction (collective intelligence) is prevalent. An educational outcome suggests that readers who engage in Teen Fiction learn to read Classics and to judge books not only indirect emotional response toc haracter’s behaviour, but focusing more on contextualised interpretation of the text.\nIn PLOS ONE https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226708\nData and code: https://osf.io/5gxmn/"

In particular, we focus on cumulative cultural evolution, that is, the idea that cultural systems improve with time, drawing on previous innovations. In this study we examine two features of cumulative culture: accumulation and improvement. First, we show that stories in Harry Potter’s fan fiction accumulate cultural traits—unique tags, in our analysis—through time, both globally and at the level of single stories. Second, more recent stories are also liked more by readers than earlier stories. Our research illustrates the potential of the combination of cultural evolution theory and digital literary studies, and it paves the way for the study of the effects of online digital media on cultural cumulation.\nIn CHR 2020: Workshop on Computational Humanities Research, November 18–20, 2020, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
