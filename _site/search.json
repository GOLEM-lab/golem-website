    "text": "Abstract\nGraphs can be used as a model for online social networks. In this framework, vertices represent individuals and edges relationships between individuals. In recent years, different approaches have been considered to offer data privacy to online social networks and for developing graph protection. Perturbative approaches are formally defined in terms of perturbation and modification of graphs. In this paper, we discuss the concept of P -stability on graphs and its relation to data privacy. The concept of P -stability is rooted in the number of graphs given a fixed degree sequence. In this paper, we show that for any graph there exists a class of P -stable graphs. This result implies that there is a fully polynomial randomized approximation for graph masking for the graphs in the class. In order to further refine the classification of a given graph, we introduce the concept of natural class of a graph. It is based on a class of scale-free networks.\nIEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing 4(3), 374-381"

Several models have been formulated to infer the structure of such archaeological networks. The underlying propositions about mechanisms regulating the formation of ties in the past are often articulated on a dyadic basis and therefore rarely account for dependencies among ties. Here, we present a general framework in which we combine exponential random graph models with archaeological substantiations of mechanisms that may be responsible for network formation to account for tie dependence. We use data collected over a set of sites in the Caribbean during the period AD 100 - 400 to illustrate the steps to obtain a network reconstruction.\nJournal of Archaeological Method and Theory 27, 192-219"

The first model generates multigraphs by randomly coupling pairs of stubs according to a fixed degree sequence so that edge assignments to vertex pair sites are dependent. The second model is a simplification that ignores the dependency between the edge assignments. It is investigated when this ignorance is justified so that the simplified model can be used as an approximation, thus facilitating the structural analysis of network data with multiple relations and loops. The comparison is based on the local properties of multigraphs given by marginal distribution of edge multiplicities and some local properties that are aggregations of global properties.\nJournal of Mathematical Sociology 40(4), 239-264"

The first model is random stub matching given fixed degrees (RSM) so that edge assignments to vertex pair sites are dependent, and the second is independent edge assignments (IEA) according to a common probability distribution. Tests are performed using goodness of fit measures between the edge multiplicity sequence of an observed multigraph, and the expected one according to a simple or composite hypothesis. Test statistics of Pearson type and of likelihood ratio type are used, and the expected values of the Pearson statistic under the different models are derived. Test performances based on simulations indicate that even for small number of edges, the null distributions of both statistics are well approximated by their asymptotic χ2-distribution. The non-null distributions of the test statistics can be well approximated by proposed adjusted χ2-distributions used for power approximations. The influence of RSM on both test statistics is substantial for small number of edges and implies a shift of their distributions towards smaller values compared to what holds true for the null distributions under IEA. Two applications on social networks are included to illustrate how the tests can guide in the analysis of social structure.\nJournal of Applied Statistics"

Special attention is given to a random multigraph model based on independent edge assignments to sites of vertex pairs and some useful measures of the local and global structure under this model are presented.

    "text": "Abstract\nSubstantial progress in the application of multiple isotope analyses has greatly improved the ability to identify nonlocal individuals amongst archaeological populations over the past decades. More recently the development of large scale models of spatial isotopic variation (isoscapes) has contributed to improved geographic assignments of human and animal origins. Persistent challenges remain, however, in the accurate identification of individual geographic origins from skeletal isotope data in studies of human (and animal) migration and provenance. In an attempt to develop and test more standardized and quantitative approaches to geographic assignment of individual origins using isotopic data two methods, combining 87Sr/86Sr and d18O isoscapes, are examined for the Circum-Caribbean region 1) an Interval approach using a defined range of fixed isotopic variation per location and 2) a Likelihood assignment approach using univariate and bivariate probability density functions. These two methods are tested with enamel isotope data from a modern sample of known origin from Caracas, Venezuela and further explored with two archaeological samples of unknown origin recovered from Cuba and Trinidad. The results emphasize both the potential and limitation of the different approaches. Validation tests on the known origin sample exclude most areas of the Circum-Caribbean region and correctly highlight Caracas as a possible place of origin with both approaches. The positive validation results clearly demonstrate the overall efficacy of a dual-isotope approach to geoprovenance. The accuracy and precision of geographic assignments may be further improved by better understanding of the relationships between environmental and biological isotope variation; continued development and refinement of relevant isoscapes; and the eventual incorporation of a broader array of isotope proxy data.\nPLoS ONE 12(2), e0172562"

The first model is random stub matching given fixed degrees (RSM) so that edge assignments to vertex pair sites are dependent, and the second is independent edge assignments (IEA) according to a common probability distribution. Tests are performed using goodness of fit measures between the edge multiplicity sequence of an observed multigraph, and the expected one according to a simple or composite hypothesis. Test statistics of Pearson type and of likelihood ratio type are used, and the expected values of the Pearson statistic under the different models are derived. Test performances based on simulations indicate that even for small number of edges, the null distributions of both statistics are well approximated by their asymptotic χ2-distribution. The non-null distributions of the test statistics can be well approximated by proposed adjusted χ2-distributions used for power approximations. The influence of RSM on both test statistics is substantial for small number of edges and implies a shift of their distributions towards smaller values compared to what holds true for the null distributions under IEA. Two applications on social networks are included to illustrate how the tests can guide in the analysis of social structure.\nJournal of Applied Statistics"

The first model generates multigraphs by randomly coupling pairs of stubs according to a fixed degree sequence so that edge assignments to vertex pair sites are dependent. The second model is a simplification that ignores the dependency between the edge assignments. It is investigated when this ignorance is justified so that the simplified model can be used as an approximation, thus facilitating the structural analysis of network data with multiple relations and loops. The comparison is based on the local properties of multigraphs given by marginal distribution of edge multiplicities and some local properties that are aggregations of global properties.\nJournal of Mathematical Sociology 40(4), 239-264"

In recent years, different approaches have been considered to offer data privacy to online social networks and for developing graph protection. Perturbative approaches are formally defined in terms of perturbation and modification of graphs. In this paper, we discuss the concept of P -stability on graphs and its relation to data privacy. The concept of P -stability is rooted in the number of graphs given a fixed degree sequence. In this paper, we show that for any graph there exists a class of P -stable graphs. This result implies that there is a fully polynomial randomized approximation for graph masking for the graphs in the class. In order to further refine the classification of a given graph, we introduce the concept of natural class of a graph. It is based on a class of scale-free networks.\nIEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing 4(3), 374-381"

The main purpose of this article is to show the versatility of a multigraph approach when analysing social networks. Multigraph data structures are described and it is exemplified how they naturally occur in many contexts but also how they can be constructed by different kinds of aggregation in graphs. Special attention is given to a random multigraph model based on independent edge assignments to sites of vertex pairs and some useful measures of the local and global structure under this model are presented. Further, it is shown how some general measures of simplicity and complexity of multigraphs are easily handled under the present model.\n‘Journal of Social Structure 16, 1-22’"

    "text": "Abstract\nSubstantial progress in the application of multiple isotope analyses has greatly improved the ability to identify nonlocal individuals amongst archaeological populations over the past decades. More recently the development of large scale models of spatial isotopic variation (isoscapes) has contributed to improved geographic assignments of human and animal origins. Persistent challenges remain, however, in the accurate identification of individual geographic origins from skeletal isotope data in studies of human (and animal) migration and provenance. In an attempt to develop and test more standardized and quantitative approaches to geographic assignment of individual origins using isotopic data two methods, combining 87Sr/86Sr and d18O isoscapes, are examined for the Circum-Caribbean region 1) an Interval approach using a defined range of fixed isotopic variation per location and 2) a Likelihood assignment approach using univariate and bivariate probability density functions. These two methods are tested with enamel isotope data from a modern sample of known origin from Caracas, Venezuela and further explored with two archaeological samples of unknown origin recovered from Cuba and Trinidad. The results emphasize both the potential and limitation of the different approaches. Validation tests on the known origin sample exclude most areas of the Circum-Caribbean region and correctly highlight Caracas as a possible place of origin with both approaches. The positive validation results clearly demonstrate the overall efficacy of a dual-isotope approach to geoprovenance. The accuracy and precision of geographic assignments may be further improved by better understanding of the relationships between environmental and biological isotope variation; continued development and refinement of relevant isoscapes; and the eventual incorporation of a broader array of isotope proxy data.\nPLoS ONE 12(2), e0172562"

Several models have been formulated to infer the structure of such archaeological networks. The underlying propositions about mechanisms regulating the formation of ties in the past are often articulated on a dyadic basis and therefore rarely account for dependencies among ties. Here, we present a general framework in which we combine exponential random graph models with archaeological substantiations of mechanisms that may be responsible for network formation to account for tie dependence. We use data collected over a set of sites in the Caribbean during the period AD 100 - 400 to illustrate the steps to obtain a network reconstruction.\nJournal of Archaeological Method and Theory 27, 192-219"

Using multivariate entropies we show how it is possible to systematically check for tendencies in data that can be described as independencies or conditional independencies, or as dependencies allowing certain combinations of variables to predict other variables. We also show how different structural models can be tested by divergence measures obtained from the multivariate entropies.\nBulletin of Sociological Methodology/Bulletin de Méthodologie Sociologique 120(1), 45-63"

    "text": "Abstract\nPottery is a mainstay of archaeological analysis worldwide. Often, high proportions of the pottery recovered from a given site are decorated in some manner. In northern Iroquoia, late pre-contact pottery and early contact decoration commonly occur on collars—thick bands of clay that encircle a pot and extend several centimeters down from the lip. These decorations constitute signals that conveyed information about a pot’s user(s). In southern Ontario the period A.D. 1350 to 1650 witnessed substantial changes in socio-political and settlement systems that included population movement, coalescence of formerly separate communities into large villages and towns, waxing and waning of regional strife, the formation of nations, and finally the development of three confederacies that each occupied distinct, constricted areas. Social network analysis demonstrates that signaling practices changed to reflect these regional patterns. Networks become more consolidated through time ultimately resulting in a “small world” network with small degrees of separation between sites reflecting the integration of communities within and between the three confederacies.\nPLoS ONE 11(5), e0156178"

    "text": "Abstract\nModel-based reconstruction is an approach to infer network structures where they cannot be observed. For archaeological networks, several models based on assumptions concerning distance among sites, site size, or costs and benefits have been proposed to infer missing ties. Since these assumptions are formulated at a dyadic level, they do not provide means to express dependencies among ties and therefore include less plausible network scenarios. In this paper we investigate the use of network models that explicitly incorporate tie dependence. In particular, we consider exponential random graph models, and show how they can be applied to reconstruct networks coherent with Burt’s arguments on closure and structural holes (Burt 2001).

The social systems arising exhibit patterns of interest, and social network analysis is the study of how and why these patterns emerge, sustain, and evolve. Of primary interest is thus to understand and describe the social processes that support the observed structure. These processes are founded in theories about network representation and theories about observed social phenomena. The benefit from network conceptualisation is thus obtained by outlining the association and distinction between these theories. This entry serves as an introduction to fundamental network concepts and analytical approaches, their potential for studying social phenomena, and a description of why they are central to theoretical constructs. This entry also provides a short introduction to statistical network modelling for cross-sectional and longitudinal network data.\nSAGE Research Methods Foundations"

It shows how size and complexity vary for different types of equivalence classes of graphs defined by ignoring only edge labels or ignoring both edge and vertex labels. Complexity is quantified by the distribution of edge multiplicities, and different complexity measures are discussed. Basic occupancy models for multigraphs are used to illustrate different graph distributions on isomorphism and complexity. The loss of information caused by ignoring edge and vertex labels is quantified by entropy and joint information that provide tools for studying properties of and relations between different graph families.\nIn 2012 JSM Proceedings: Papers Presented at the Joint Statistical Meetings, San Diego, California, July 28-August 2, 2012, and Other ASA-sponsored Conferences, American Statistical Association, 2012"
