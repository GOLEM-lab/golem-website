## Project Summary
Since 2019, I'm sporadically working on a project with [Pete Jones](https://www.petejon.es/) which aims to apply existing and novel quantitative methods (e.g. relational event models, entropy based natural language processing and multigraph representations), to study the gendered inequalities in popular cinema. See Pete's website for more information and some awesome packages such as [charinet](https://github.com/pj398/charinet) which he has developed on the topic.
