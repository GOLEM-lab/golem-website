## project summary
This interdisciplinary research aims to apply novel quantitative methods, (e.g. entropy based natural language processing and signed network approaches) to study the gendered inequalities in popular cinema.

This projects addresses questions as follows: In what ways can a systematic framework based on multivariate statistical entropies be developed to analyse monadic and dyadic data from the digital humanities? How can network methods illuminate the patterns of gendered homosocial- ity that circulate through popular cultural texts? To what extent, and in what ways, are female charactersâ€™ narrative interactions patterns biased or stereotypical?
