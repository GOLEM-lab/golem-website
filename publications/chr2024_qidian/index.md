## Abstract 
The evolution of online reading platforms has transformed engagement with fiction, with platforms like WebNovel bridging cultural boundaries through translated Chinese web novels. This study employs topic modeling to compare reader responses to the same stories published in Chinese on Qidian and in English on WebNovel, focusing on English and Chinese language comments. We identify shared and unique themes, revealing that while both communities emphasize characterization and story development, cultural-specific expressions and platform dynamics shape readersâ€™ interactions. Our findings underscore the nuanced interplay between language, culture, and the affordances of digital platforms in shaping global literary consumption and community engagement.
