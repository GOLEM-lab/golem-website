## Abstract 
This contribution presents the GOLEM Knowledge Graph and interface, offering different perspectives into content-related data and metadata from the domain of fanfiction narratives. The Knowledge Graph is aligned with common ontologies and vocabularies from the domains of narrative and cultural heritage. In this short paper, we outline how narrative organization and charactersâ€™ features are modelled in the GOLEM knowledge graph. The GOLEM UI is also presented, a user-friendly access point to the data that allows to browse the knowledge graph even without knowledge of SPARQL.
