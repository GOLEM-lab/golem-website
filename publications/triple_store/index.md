## Abstract 
In this paper, we present the GOLEM triple store, a massive triple store resource for fiction and narrative. This triple store is the first step towards a large-scale knowledge-graph for stories, as well as characters and events in narratives. At the moment, it contains more than 8 million stories collected from the Archive of Our Own (AO3), providing scholars with a tool to derive unique insights into fan narratives and storytelling trends over time.
