## Abstract 
This paper introduces the GOLEM ontology, a novel framework designed to provide a structured 
and computationally tractable representation of narrative and fictional elements. Addressing 
limitations in existing ontologies regarding the integration of fictional entities and diverse 
narrative theories, our model extends CIDOC CRM and LRMoo and leverages DOLCE’s cognitive 
foundations to provide a flexible and interoperable framework. The ontology captures complexities 
of narrative structure, character dynamics, and fictional worlds while supporting provenance 
tracking and pluralistic interpretations. The modular structure facilitates alignment with various 
literary and narrative theories and integration of external resources. Future work will focus on 
expanding domain-specific extensions, validating the model through larger-scale case studies, and 
developing a reader response module to systematically model the reception of narratives. 
By fostering interoperability between literary theory, fan cultures, and computational analysis, 
this ontology lays a foundation for interoperable comparative research on narrative and fiction.
