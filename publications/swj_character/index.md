## Abstract 
The study of fictional characters has always been a crucial part of literary research. 
Characters are one of the core elements that drive the development of narratives 
and convey the themes and messages of literary works. With the rise of participatory
culture, especially fan cultures, the way people interact with and reinterpret 
fictional characters has become more complex and dynamic, a change that poses unique
challenges and opportunities for analyzing character representation across cultures,
genres, and platforms. This paper reports on, documents, and discusses a formal 
ontology that enables the systematic modeling and comparison of fictional characters
across cultures and reading communities. Building upon literary theory and incorporating
insights from crowd-sourced online databases, the GOLEM ontology provides a framework
for analyzing both canonical characterizations and fan-driven reinterpretations.
