## Abstract 
This paper investigates the methodological foundations and theoretical assumptions 
behind the construction of computational ontologies for modeling narrative and 
fiction, with a focus on literary characters. We survey and critically assess 
a set of existing domain-specific ontologies for fictional narrative, evaluating 
their modeling strategies, taking into consideration their philosophical and 
knowledge representation criteria. Drawing from ontology engineering principles 
and foundational frameworks such as DOLCE, BFO, and CIDOC-CRM, we propose a 
two-class ontology mapping methodology (harmonisation and alignment) to evaluate 
and foster semantic interoperability across the considered models. An experimental 
ontology pattern for fictional characters is then introduced and aligned with both 
DOLCE and BFO via CIDOC-CRM, revealing the ontological commitments and modeling 
trade-offs required to formalise the nuanced nature of fictional entities. 
This study offers a preliminary attempt to explore how foundational ontologies 
might support conceptual clarity, while also highlighting the epistemological 
challenges involved in representing complex, non-referential cultural artifacts. 
Ultimately, this work aims to highlight the relevance of ontologies as a shared 
infrastructure for computational literary studies, supporting interdisciplinary 
collaboration, fostering Open Science and encouraging more structured, transparent, 
and conceptually grounded approaches to the representation and analysis of cultural phenomena.
