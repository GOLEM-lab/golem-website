<div class="habout">The project</div>
The "Graphs and Ontologies for Literary Evolution Models" is a 5-year (2023-2027) research project funded by the European Commission (ERC StG).

The **goal** of the project is to create accurate models of how the (formal and content-related) cultural traits of fiction spread and combine. The data used are fanfiction stories in 5 different languages (English, Spanish, Italian, Korean, and Indonesian) gathered from various online platforms.

The **methodology** combines mainly computational literary studies and cultural evolution theory, with influences from fan studies and information science.

The project is **hosted** by the Center for Langugage and Cognition and the Center for Digital Humanities of the University of Groningen (Netherlands).

More details coming soon...
