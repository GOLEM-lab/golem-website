<div class="habout">The project</div>
The "Graphs and Ontologies for Literary Evolution Models" is a 5-year (2023-2027) research project funded by the European Commission (ERC StG).

The **goal** of the project is to create accurate models of how the (formal and content-related) cultural traits of fiction spread and combine. The data used are fanfiction stories in 5 different languages (English, Spanish, Italian, Korean, and Indonesian) gathered from various online platforms.

The **methodology** combines mainly computational literary studies and cultural evolution theory, with influences from fan studies and information science.

The project is **hosted** by the Center for Langugage and Cognition and the Center for Digital Humanities of the University of Groningen (Netherlands).

Millions of stories are shared on online platforms such as Wattpad, AO3, and Fanfiction.net, combined with readers' reactions and comments on these stories. The GOLEM project will analyze stories and their responses gathered from sites in five different languages â€“ **English, Spanish, Italian, Korean and Indonesian**. This analysis can provide a wealth of information about the characters in a story, the genre, what a story is about, how a story is constructed, what themes are covered, as well as what readers from different countries and cultures find important in a story.

- What (linguistic, stylistic, thematic) elements in a story become popular in different languages?
- What makes a story get read, and what do readers value in a story?

The information we collect with this research makes it possible, with the help of computer models, to find answers to these kinds of questions. The goal is to test hypotheses about cultural evolution and develop a methodology that can also be applied to books from other periods in history. In this way, we can study the evolution of fiction over the centuries, and gain unprecedented insight into something as old as humanity itself: storytelling
